It felt like a beacon of light in my otherwise dark and overwhelming journey. We were all struggling, and there was a certain comfort in knowing that we're not alone in this. It's not easy to handle everything by myself, especially as a surviving child. I feel deeply disconnected without guidance and attention from my grieving adults, but sharing my experiences with everyone at TAPS gave me some sense of purpose and connection. Though I still face many challenges, this weekend has reminded me that we're all in this together, and that is what I find immensely comforting.\"\n",
